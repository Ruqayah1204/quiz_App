### Landing Page
**Header and Navigation:**
The landing page welcomes users with a clean header accompanied by a navigation bar. Within the navigation bar, the "Read Instruction" menu stands out as a unique feature. Clicking on this menu triggers a modal that offers users a glimpse of quiz instructions before embarking on the quiz journey.

**Hero Section:**
Central to the landing page is the hero section, featuring a prominent "Start Quiz" button. This strategic placement encourages users to dive into the quiz immediately, creating a seamless transition to the quiz page.

### Quiz Page
**Dynamic Design:**
Upon clicking "Start Quiz," users are ushered into a dynamically designed quiz page. Here, each question is presented at random.

**Real-Time Time Functionality:**
The quiz page doesn't merely present questions; it dynamically initiates the timer functionality as soon as the quiz loads. This real-time feature adds an element of urgency, enhancing the overall excitement of the quiz-taking experience.

**Immediate Feedback:**
As users progress through the quiz, they receive immediate feedback on their answers. Whether correct or incorrect, this instant feedback keeps users informed and engaged, contributing to a richer learning experience.

### Result Page
**Conditional Messaging:**
Upon completion of the quiz, users are directed to the result page. Here, a conditional statement evaluates the user's score, triggering personalized messages based on their performance. Whether the user excelled, achieved an average score, or fell below average, the app communicates with them in a way that resonates.

## Challenges and Triumphs
**Research and Implementation Challenges:**
